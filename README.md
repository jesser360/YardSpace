YardSpace is a social platform that provides a much needed service for many weary eyes travelers. This app will connect them with hosts that have made their yards available for these folks to come camp in.

The app uses features such as a booking system, real time messaging, reviews, and friend requests to make connection between users as smooth as possible. There is also a live weather report for each city page to make sure campers stay dry and warm the whole time. The app was written with Ruby On Rails using a postgresql database. I used the date picking and httpParty gem, and all other features have been hand built. So go explore a new place and never have to worry about finding a place to camp again!
