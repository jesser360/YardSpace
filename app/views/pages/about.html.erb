<h1 class="about" style ="color:lightgray">About YardSpace</h1>
<h2 class="about"  style ="color:lightgray">My friends and I originally came up with the idea for Yardspace while on a 5 month journey through East Africa. As budget travelers we almost exclusively couchsurfed or found camping in quiet areas. Where we found couchsurfing lacking was if we were passing through a town for just a day or two and needed a quick spot to stay, or if there was a large group of us and no one could accomadate us. We were often forced to “stress” camp somewhere potentially illegal or dangerous in a country we didn’t know very well.</h2>
  <h2 class="about"  style ="color:lightgray">As we fell into that situation more and more, the idea of Yardspace came about. Yardspace works in much of the same way as couchsurfing but it's far less invasive for the hosts, minimizes many of the potential security issues, is ideal for the outdoors lover who want to travel cheaply.</h2>
